My area of expertise is utilizing the customer service skills I've developed over the years to assist others with their needs and desires. With my previous experience on jobs I was able to learn basic computer maintenance, how to manage different applications, and build determination in finding resolutions to issues in order to help customers enjoy their electronics after purchasing with best buy. Although I am skilled with some education in computer technology, I also have experience in many other fields. I've experienced training and development in careers including sales agent to working with others as a direct support worker and care giver. Being able to exercise my bubbly personality with the diverse training background has evolved my ability to learn and grasp knowledge.
